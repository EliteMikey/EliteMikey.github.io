  <h2>
    Lore
  </h2>
  <p>
    Moira O'Deorain is a person of Irish heritage who originally worked for Blackwatch, a division of Overwatch that
    focused primarily on secret missions. Unfortunately, she was kicked out for her unethical experiments that, in her
    opinion, are essential to push humanity's limits, which coincided with Doomfist's goal. Afterward, she was recruited
    into Talon, a terrorist organization, that gave her a deal: resources that went toward her experiments in exchange
    for her talent. Currently, she is one of the leaders of Talon alongside Doomfist and was responsible for giving
    Reaper his mist powers as well as brainwashing Widowmaker and Sigma into joining her organization.
